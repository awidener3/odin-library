# odin-library
Odin's Library is a simple program that allows you to log the title, author, # of pages, and read status of a book that you own. That book becomes an object that is displayed in a card that can then be used to update the read status of the book, or remove the book from your collection.
The program also uses localStorage so that you are able to keep your books each time you visit the webpage.
